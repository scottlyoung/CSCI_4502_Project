## Project Description

This project sought to look at complaints that comsumers made against various companies. We downloaded the database of the complaints from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database#topic=consumer_navigation. We used this data to find out what companies had the most complaints filed against them, when the complaints were made graphed by type, what states had the most complaints, and the ratio of complaints to population in each state.

We found that Patenaude & Felix APC led the field with the most complaints made against them. 

As for when the complaints were made, Mortgage complaints started out heavy when the data started in December of 2011. This type of complaint led the field until December of 2014 when Debt Collection complaints rose to teh same area. The trend of all the complaint types has risen steadily since December of 2011 all the way until January of 2017.

Florida and California led the field with over 64,000 complaints apiece. However, when compared to teh population of the state, Florida and California were beaten by Maryland and Delaware by a landslide.

## Application of Knowledge

This knowledge can be applied to find states where business practices are likely less shady. This may also be able to find states where companies are held more accountable for their actions and therefore less likely to be shady.
