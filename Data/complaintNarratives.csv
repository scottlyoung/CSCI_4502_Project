11/20/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I built my home in XXXX and had a Countrywide Home Loan. My husband died XXXX XXXX. I had to file chapter XXXX on his medical bills. My attorney sent to Countrywide that my loan was excluded from the bankruptcy and debt reaffirmed. Between the time my bankruptcy was discharged, which was XXXX Bank of America purchased my loan from Countrywide who did not pass along my file or reaffirmation on my mortgage. A few months after my bankruptcy discharge, I received notice from Bank of America that my home loan was discharged and I was going to be evicted. I had never missed a loan payment and always paid on time. 

Shocked and phoned my attorney and then BofA. My attorney forward the reaffirmation to BofA who stated it was too late. I was then advised by Bank of America that due to my circumstances I apply for a modification loan, which when signed would reassign my debt. The beginning of the BofA lies. 

In order to qualify they instructed me to stop paying my mortgage, as I was current on my loan. So stopped payment as instructed filled out the loan modification paperwork. After two years of lost files, eviction threats, repeated loan modification applications, thousands of repeated documents sent over and over again, XXXX different representatives, crying at Bank of America modification offices from frustration, endless letters to the president/ceo of bank of america, only to get generic letters back, trying to make my mortgage payment without acceptance. 

I had lost my husband and then spent 2 years fighting not to lose my home which I should never have had to do. I then tried to stop the modification but they would allow me to pay my mortgage stating I was in default and my loan was discharged. I would n't have been in default if they would n't have made stop paying my mortgage, claiming I did n't qualify for the modification since my loan was current. 

It was the most stressful 2 years on this BofA merry go round. I put $ XXXX down on my home. I had a great job and could afford my payments. I did n't want to lose my home, I had just lost my husband. I finally saw on the news that BofA was in trouble and they were send representatives to meet in person for those that had modification applications. I phoned the # and was able to get an appointment letter. I slept on the floor of the convention center in XXXX XXXX to meet with a BofA rep. I was finally given a loan modification on XXXX/XXXX/2012 at the convention center. What I was offered I did n't understand, my loan balance was {$370000.00}, they charged me the {$370000.00} plus {$60000.00} for fees making my loan modification balance {$430000.00}. I was given no adjustment no discounts as originally promised. I signed the documents, not knowing what to do. I was a widow and I did n't want to lose my home and was exhausted from fighting to get out of the application process. 

I received a letter from BofA stating that my loan modification was recorded and they would be reporting to the XXXX credit bureaus and it again would appear on my credit as a current loan, as it had appeared on my credit as a "" discharged '' debt. 

Well guess what that never happened. My credit still shows the debt as discharged in my bankruptcy, the modification did not reconfirm my debt. Again never missed a payment, a letter from BofA stating that would happen and years of asking for them to honor their word. Nothing. 
I hired another attorney, in speaking to BofA they told my attorney that they would have to re-open my bankruptcy that was discharged XXXX. The attorney, XXXX XXXX tried but the judge would not re-open my bankruptcy to reinstate my debt. So I have paid for years on a mortgage that is discharged, yet I have a loan that I am paying on. 

2nd issue, I had a second on my original home loan with Countrywide that was also discharged in my bankruptcy.

Some years ago, with my mother present, I presented the original ( stamped with seal ) "" Durable Power of Attorney '' at the Charter One branch office located on XXXX in XXXX, Michigan for their record file.

'' On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I was contacted by Charter One Master Card someone had made fraudulent charges on my mother 's credit card account.

Upon receiving my mother 's new credit card I realized she was entitled to "" XXXX '' bonus points. I telephoned the bank to redeem her "" XXXX XXXX '' bonus points and I was informed my name was not on my mother 's credit card account. I informed them, I had taken the original "" Durable Power of Attorney '' into the branch office and it should be on file. The representative indicated there was a "" Durable Power of Attorney '' on file with Charter One Bank but Master Card is a separate entity from the bank and would require another "" Durable Power of Attorney.

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I went into the Charter One Bank located ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, in XXXX, Michigan, XXXX. I was told no branch manager was available - the bank teller made copies of "" Durable Power of Attorney '' and stated she would forward the document to the branch manager the following day to resolve the issue.

Let me explain to you why I believe this : For years, SunTrust advertised and promoted in big letters their XXXX XXXX debit card. With that card, an account holder could earn XXXX mile for every {$1.00} spent ( for debit and credit card transactions ). SunTrust even advertised that they would not put a cap on a cardholder 's ability to earn miles. 

Over the past XXXX months, SunTrust must have reviewed their debit card portfolio and what they did as a result of their review is shocking : They closed all account holders who had earned above average number of miles regardless of the types of products they purchased, regardless of the length of their relationship with SunTrust, and regardless of the amount of money in their checking accounts. I know of at least XXXX cases where SunTrust contacted XXXX XXXX to have the miles in the cardholder 's account reversed!!! 

SunTrust is clearly engaging in what is commonly referred to as "" bait and switch '', a marketing strategy of getting customers to sign up for a product ( that, by the way, carries a yearly fee of {$75.00} ) and then, once a certain number of miles are earned, the account is closed. This is unacceptable and a regulatory violation. 

If SunTrust does not immediately stop closing accounts and reversing miles already earned, I 'll notify a well-known XXXX XXXX lawfirm to pursue a class action lawsuit against SunTrust and its XXXX and XXXX individually.

( My son lives in XXXX ) On XXXX XXXX, I 've realized there was a mistype in the XXXX he gave to me. I called the Citizens Bank Wire Department and was able to fix the number and they told me the money would be available in XXXX on XXXX XXXX. 
Until XXXX XXXX XXXX, the money has not arrived in my son 's checking account in XXXX, but left my account on XXXX XXXX. 
I 've called Citizens Wire Department many times and they told me the money was transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX and that XXXX XXXX XXXX would be responsible for that wire transfer. 
I 've asked if they could trace the money since it 's been more than 2 weeks, they ca n't. XXXX XXXX XXXX is the bank responsible for that and if XXXX XXXX XXXX has not called them to say something went wrong, they do n't communicate with XXXX XXXX XXXX, they assume everything went well. Although I 've been calling to let them know it has not. 
They also told me I could start a process to get my money back in my checking account with Citizens but I would lose the fees I 've paid for the wire transfer to be made. 
I just want to find out what happened to the money. Even if there was something wrong I should have gotten a phone call or something.. This is not the way a Bank should treat a client/customer who trusted the Bank. This is disrespectful! 
Another thing, they should clear state to the customers they are NOT allowed to do International Transactions and that their money is going to be transferred to another Bank for the transaction to be complete.

I just want Citizens Bank to be responsible for the deal I 've lost in my country - that money was supposed to buy a condo and, of course, I lost the deal! 
I want Citizens Bank to trace all my phone calls ( They 've been recorded ) and try to figure out WHY their employees did n't take an action on XXXX/XXXX/15 when I made the XXXX phone call to complain about a delay ... They should know better.

The sales associate put my old mailing address from my license which I did not notice at that time because he did not ask this question of my current mailing address. I wait for my card to arrive in the mail for a month but I do n't get one. So I decided to give a call to their customer service number. I mentioned to the representative that I do n't have the card with me, but I like to make the payment and I confirmed my identity as was asked by the representative. she insisted that she ca n't take the payment till I have the card with me, so I reasoned that since I do n't have the card and I do n't know my payment due date, I will be late on making payment and then you guys will charge me late fee. she was not willing to tell me my due date, but agreed to take the payment after talking to some other person. after while she says the payment processing system is down and I should call back to make the payment. I call back in a couple of days again to make the payment and I am told that it is late now. I told them that the other day another representative was n't willing to take my payment and was n't willing to tell my due date, so how can I make the payment on time? After another month, I call back to make another payment and I repeat the same thing that I still have not received my card yet, but would like to make a payment and not sure if I am late on making payment. This time the representative tells me that I have missed the due date. She offers to verify my mailing address and then I tell her if my old address is on record. she tells me that this is the case of old address on record. she tells me that she will go ahead and update mailing address and send me a new card to that address and also wave the late fee because it was n't my fault. She told me not to worry about late fee being charged. I receive my card this month and I log into my account to find out that I am charged late fee in the last two months, so I decide to give them call again. This time the representative tells me that what do I want him to do even after explaining all the situation. when I ask him to reimburse my late fees because it was not my fault and I did my part to reach out every time. he says everything is being documented, but he can only reimburse {$18.00}. I said how is that possible since I was not at fault and I was assured of not being charged late fee. And when I tried to make the payment on time, the representative tells that their system is down. so I feel that they are using the deceptive practices of charging customers late fees under the pretext wrong policy of not sharing the due date even after verifying their identity and not taking the payment before due date so they can put the blame on the customers after the due date is passed. I am sure I will be vindicated if their recorded calls record is asked for as they will not share that with me. All I asking for is to wave those late fees as I was not at fault at all. Please guide me for the right remedy for this problem.

I made all of my payments on time, which kept me locked into my trial modification agreement. I have attached a copy of my bank records, which show the payments being withdrawn from my bank account each month since the trial modification began. After the initial XXXX month trial period, I was informed by XXXX XXXX XXXX that my permanent loan modification documents were not ready to be produced yet. I was instructed by XXXX to keep making my payments each month in the same amount as the trial period payment. I ended up making payments for XXXX and XXXX in the trial amount of {$640.00}. I spoke to an XXXX representative named XXXX in XXXX XXXX. He informed me that I can begin to make my payments in the amount of the permanently modified payment, which came out to be {$850.00}, but the permanent documents are not ready yet. I made the payments for XXXX and XXXX XXXX in this amount. 
I spoke to XXXX from XXXX again on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. He was very apologetic about the errors on XXXX 's end. He explained that the XXXX and XXXX payments are short of the normally scheduled payment of {$850.00} because they had informed us to make payments of {$640.00} during these months. Each XXXX of these months is {$200.00} short from making a full modified payment. In order to credit the account for the full payments in XXXX and XXXX, he said the account is due for {$410.00}. He informed us to make the shortage payment along with the payment for XXXX and the account will be permanently modified and brought completely current. This would allow them to apply all of the funds properly through XXXX XXXX, XXXX. He said XXXX is working to rectify the issue prior to the transfer to Select Portfolio Servicing, but they will notify SPS of their error prior to the transfer so that there are no issues with the modification when the loan is transferred to SPS. 
As you can see in my bank records, which are attached, I made the payment to Select Portfolio Servicing on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX in the amount of {$1200.00}, which can be broken down into {$410.00} for the shortage in XXXX and XXXX plus {$850.00} for the XXXX payment plus an additional {$30.00}.

I ended up submitting a dispute letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I received a response on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX that SPS could not find any errors on their end and there is still a delinquency on the account. However, this is not correct information, as you can see in my bank statements that a payment has been withdrawn for each month since I began my trial modification in XXXX XXXX. I sent another dispute letter into SPS on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. They responded with the same letter as their first response and claimed that there is not a payment issue on the file and they claim that I am XXXX payment behind on the mortgage, which is not the case. I ordered a payment history to prove that payments were made, but SPS conveniently began their payment history on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, whereas the payment was made and accepted by them on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, in which they claim they did not receive the payment of {$1200.00}.

Suntrust required him to sign modification application but then when presented with quit claim, allowed me to proceed without his signature. I have completed the 4 month trial period and loan mod docs have been sent to me. 

Problem : They are now requiring ex-husband signature now. He is an unfriendly/uncooperative party and is trying to leverage his signature with his lawyers for a percentage ownership in the property and other stipulations. 

Suntrust will not let me sign alone even though I made the application alone and the calculations were based on my income alone. I need them to be compelled to allow me to sign alone. 

If I ca n't execute this modification I will have to default as I owe 6k on demand to go back to the original structure. The ex does n't care about defaulting he has family money and many lawyers. Please help me compel Suntrust to allow my sole signature on this modification.

They may notify me after the fact of any breach, however, what is a person to do if their information especially Social Security number is compromised.

With several companies, XXXX and XXXX in particular, data mining people 's information only to be sold to advertisers and whomever else for profit, I can only speculate as to what these financial institutions are doing with this information.

I have submitted over XXXX applications within the past year, and each tie they would reassign the account after 90 days by allowingthe information to expire. There was an agreement reached by the federal courts where Citi would correct the account, and offer a structured payment plan that woud be affordable. During this time XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, they assigned a rep, then it went to another. Citi agreed to a principal reduction, and sent information that exceeded my budget. however, to show good faith I paid XXXX a month to build a trial plan, where the loan could become stable and after i 'd lost my job in XX/XX/XXXX, and filed bankruptcy to see what could be done. during XX/XX/XXXX, i was just XXXX behind, as the employment ended in XX/XX/XXXX, it too Citi 3 months to offer me anything, By this time, the account had grew that it was impossible to do anything. 

Currently, I was paying Citi constantly on a monthly basis of {$1700.00} from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. I stop paying as I started receiving foreclosure notices, and realized that my payments were not being applied to my account. They had me blocked from their internet site where payments could not be applied, ( i never wrote a bad check or anything with them ) they stated its a process when they are working on accounts to limit the use where updates can be made. Therefore, i sent payments through my online bill pay, where evidence could be tracked. 

So in XXXX, Citi asked for me to send another loss mitigation application, and i did just this with the new rep, and they came XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX with a payment XXXX more than my original payment. I asked why and what were they doing, they said it was n't an explanation for it and demanded that i either accpet what they had put in the document or reject it. I then, edited the trial plan with payments in which I knew i could afford, and asked them to revised the documents ; they refused and sent my account to XXXX a foreclosure company to cause embarrassment abd economic harm when it is clear that information in which consumers are entitled too should be shared. 

at the same time, they have added {$60000.00} to my mortgage and I am not sure where this is coming from, also Citi is aware that i am a victim of preditory lending. when I purchased the home it was for sell of XXXX, and the lender sent XXXX, where the broker and agent took at least XXXX off the transaction and registered my home as sbeing purchased at XXXX. When the economy changed in XXXX, i lost my job, and paid until all of my savings were gone, then asked for the interest rate to be changed which was done in XX/XX/XXXX every since then, its been a problem, and I would get mail from different entites of Citi XXXX reflected different things. The more i tried to explain the worst it got, then finally the Ceo XXXX XXXX answered my email and we had account in good status for about 9 months. when he left, the same old systems that sent bad information before started happening again. 

i understand there are XXXX federal orders that protect homeowners like myself, and each time i have requested a face to face with Citi they declined and said we have assigned some XXXX who you can work with at your convienence which is over the phone and by email. 
This is where shuffle begans all ober, and again, and again.

03/27/2015,Mortgage,Other mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"Ocwen financial services claims simultaneously to have a loan with me ( despite my never having done business with them or having been notified of said loan ) and to have written off said loan with the IRS in XX/XX/XXXX. Further, they continue to insert themselves in a legal case I have against XXXX XXXX XXXX company regarding my foreclosure. Ocwen has claimed in a legal deposition that they are the current holder of an unsigned original, legally executed Note. XXXX has claimed that the holder of the note is the owner of the property. However, Ocwen appears to have discharged the Note according to the IRS. This Note was discharged previously by IndyMac Mortgage Services in XX/XX/XXXX ( which Ocwen is aware of as the evidence of this was shown to them at a legal deposition ). Ocwen appears to have applied a court ordered use and occupancy payment made out to XXXX to a loan ( number XXXX XXXX which Ocwen pretends to have with me. I have received no notification that any loan was transferred to Ocwen at any time, nor could this have happened since Ocwen was not ( and does not claim ) any involvement until long after a foreclosure had already taken place on the property. Further, Ocwen did not ( according to their own testimony at deposition ) become holder of any Note or Loan through the purchase of the assets of IndyMac Mortgage Services from XXXX ( or any other entity ), rather, they claim this happened as a result of XXXX giving them an original copy of a legally executed Note where it was held in a vault from the time of foreclosure. These very facts are in dispute in a court of law at the moment and the case is pending appeal. 
In filing a tax for claiming to discharge a note that they did not had and had been previously discharged, Ocwen is guilty of tax fraud against the IRS. In claiming to have a loan with me and/or attached to my property, Ocwen is committing fraud. If Ocwen is claiming to have a loan with me, I was never notified of this fact as required by federal law and I dispute any such claim. By assigning a payment to a loan which does n't exist, Ocwen is committing fraud, since they simultaneously claim that they discharged the debt last year and the check was not made out to Ocwen Financial it 's parent or subsidiary or related companies which constitutes check fraud. Further, Ocwen is violating the court order for use and occupancy, which they are not entitled to since they are not part of the legal action. Further, Ocwen is clearly conspiring with XXXX and is costing me money. Finally, Ocwen was previously notified of their tax fraud by registered letter, so they are already aware ( or should be aware ) that their behavior is inappropriate and likely illegal.

Nationstar is docking me 30 days late for the months of XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX because of the payment that was "" sent back to me ' from XXXX.

I scheduled my XXXX XXXX payment and received a confirmation email. I did not receive anything from Nationstar until I received my XX/XX/XXXX statement, showing that my XX/XX/XXXX payment was due. I contacted them by phone and asked why they had not presented the payment to my bank. I was transferred from person to person to person, and finally the collection department, who was rude and belligerent. They would not listen or understand that my XX/XX/XXXX payment and my XX/XX/XXXX payments were made on time. They kept trying to make me pay extra fees and said my next 6 payments needed to be mailed in, and certified. I explained that the website caused the error, but they would not listen and would not use common sense to see the problem. To date, they have never sent me anything rejecting the XX/XX/XXXX payment. They keep saying I put a stop payment on the XX/XX/XXXX payment, but my bank can clearly show that I did not. I have emailed them over and over trying to get this issue resolved and trying to make all of my payments on time. My bank records will show that I have the money in my bank every month for the full amount due. I am not trying to get out of paying ; not trying to pay late and not trying to qualify for any programs.

03/27/2015,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Managing the loan or lease,,"I filed a complaint against Ally regarding my car loan earlier today however I finally was able to speak with an agent and learned why I have had so many issues during the four years. When Ally credits a payment they credit the payment to next or current car payment but do not credit any of the funds to any amount that may be "" in arrears ''. When the next payment comes in they continue to credit the entire amount to the next payment regardless if there is a late fee or shortage in the previous/current month on the account. This keeps the customers account in a constant shortage which then incurs additional late charges and sets the customer up for reporting to the credit bureau. This is what has been happening to me since I became an Ally customer over 4 years ago. I have complained several times to Ally but they deny doing anything wrong. Today "" XXXX '' told me how Ally credits payments which explains why/how Ally has been overcharging me for the last 4 years. Per "" XXXX '' this form of accounting is perfectly acceptable. If this is the way a bank/credit union is suppose to credit payments then I have several other accounts to file complaints because none of my other lender do this underhanded accounting. I make more than XXXX payment per month so instead of Ally crediting my payments to current month or any arearage they are crediting payments to potentially future payments and leaving me with multiple late fees. When I make a payment I expect the money will be credited to what I owe - late fees, current monthly payment if additional to principle. I expect this every month.
