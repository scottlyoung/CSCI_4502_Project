11/20/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I built my home in XXXX and had a Countrywide Home Loan. My husband died XXXX XXXX. I had to file chapter XXXX on his medical bills. My attorney sent to Countrywide that my loan was excluded from the bankruptcy and debt reaffirmed. Between the time my bankruptcy was discharged, which was XXXX Bank of America purchased my loan from Countrywide who did not pass along my file or reaffirmation on my mortgage. A few months after my bankruptcy discharge, I received notice from Bank of America that my home loan was discharged and I was going to be evicted. I had never missed a loan payment and always paid on time. 

Shocked and phoned my attorney and then BofA. My attorney forward the reaffirmation to BofA who stated it was too late. I was then advised by Bank of America that due to my circumstances I apply for a modification loan, which when signed would reassign my debt. The beginning of the BofA lies. 

In order to qualify they instructed me to stop paying my mortgage, as I was current on my loan. So stopped payment as instructed filled out the loan modification paperwork. After two years of lost files, eviction threats, repeated loan modification applications, thousands of repeated documents sent over and over again, XXXX different representatives, crying at Bank of America modification offices from frustration, endless letters to the president/ceo of bank of america, only to get generic letters back, trying to make my mortgage payment without acceptance. 

I had lost my husband and then spent 2 years fighting not to lose my home which I should never have had to do. I then tried to stop the modification but they would allow me to pay my mortgage stating I was in default and my loan was discharged. I would n't have been in default if they would n't have made stop paying my mortgage, claiming I did n't qualify for the modification since my loan was current. 

It was the most stressful 2 years on this BofA merry go round. I put $ XXXX down on my home. I had a great job and could afford my payments. I did n't want to lose my home, I had just lost my husband. I finally saw on the news that BofA was in trouble and they were send representatives to meet in person for those that had modification applications. I phoned the # and was able to get an appointment letter. I slept on the floor of the convention center in XXXX XXXX to meet with a BofA rep. I was finally given a loan modification on XXXX/XXXX/2012 at the convention center. What I was offered I did n't understand, my loan balance was {$370000.00}, they charged me the {$370000.00} plus {$60000.00} for fees making my loan modification balance {$430000.00}. I was given no adjustment no discounts as originally promised. I signed the documents, not knowing what to do. I was a widow and I did n't want to lose my home and was exhausted from fighting to get out of the application process. 

I received a letter from BofA stating that my loan modification was recorded and they would be reporting to the XXXX credit bureaus and it again would appear on my credit as a current loan, as it had appeared on my credit as a "" discharged '' debt. 

Well guess what that never happened. My credit still shows the debt as discharged in my bankruptcy, the modification did not reconfirm my debt. Again never missed a payment, a letter from BofA stating that would happen and years of asking for them to honor their word. Nothing. 
I hired another attorney, in speaking to BofA they told my attorney that they would have to re-open my bankruptcy that was discharged XXXX. The attorney, XXXX XXXX tried but the judge would not re-open my bankruptcy to reinstate my debt. So I have paid for years on a mortgage that is discharged, yet I have a loan that I am paying on. 

2nd issue, I had a second on my original home loan with Countrywide that was also discharged in my bankruptcy.

03/23/2015,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Information is not mine,"I had my purse stolen in 2007. They never found the person responsible. I cancelled everything, credit cards, debit cards etc. My social security card was in this purse as well as my license. Several years later I was contacted by certified mail and told I needed to appear in court in XXXX maine. It stated I had a very large medical bill I had not paid. I called the lawyer representing the medical facility and explained it was not my bill. He took some information then and asked me if my identity had been stolen. I did n't think so, because there were no other things showing up. Since then there is a different name aka on my credit report and many, many accounts that are not mine. They are actually fairly good credit. My debt to income ration according to this report is extremely high. In actuality my debt to income is extremely low. I have tried to dispute this with XXXX. I even tried to go through XXXX XXXX. At this point the horse is out of the barn, so to speak, so XXXX XXXX does n't do me any good. I have read up on this and found that I have a crossed credit or something. They say it is the most difficult to fix. Any help you could give me would be wonderful. Thank you

03/24/2015,Credit card,,Credit line increase/decrease,,"XXXX i receive an email from citibank regarding my XXXX credit card. It was an offer to request a credit increase and it clearly stated that there would be NO Credit bureau inquiry made. I clicked on the link in the email and entered the requested information. a couple of days later I received an alert from my credit bureau monitoring service that a hard inquiry was done. Upon looking at the report it showed Citibank credit cards making a hard credit inquiry, which was completely opposite of what their email stated. I called citi and they confimred that the email stated there would be no creidt inquiry done however they said that the request was made on a different citibank credit card which is why the hard inquiry was made. I explained to the rep I clicked on the link they provided and if was for a different account of mine it was not my issue but theirs and they need to remove the inquiry. They told me to send a letter to their credit dispute department explaining it. I sent the letter after waiting more than a month I received a blunt statement stating the it was a valid credit request and they will not remove the inquiry from my credit bureau. Citi performed bait and switch by offering a no inquiry credit request and then doing a hard inquiry which has negatively affected my credit score. I asked to remove it and received a generic letter stating they would not with no number to contact the department that sent the letter when i called the main customer service number they said that department dosent talk to customers and there was nothing else they can do. 
This has negatively affected my credit score and will remain on my credit report for 2 years because citi 's False advertising. and then their lack of fixing their error

Every sense that time I have been receiving phone calls everyday. Not a day pass they are calling me and they always call from a different number so I never know who it is calling. They have caused me to pay out so much money at my Bank, at the time my Bank was XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Al. They have caused me to pay out hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees, money that I could have paid them with but they would not stop trying to debit my account. They call every day starting at around XXXX I am telling them the same thing each time they call me that I do not have any money to pay them now if I did have the money I would pay them each month until I paid them up but until my income increase I am not able to pay them. I am on a fix income and I can not pay them now and I can not tell you when I can pay because I do n't know my self. I am so tired of the harassing phone calls I am on XXXX and XXXX and every day it gets worse and worse and I ca n't keep putting up with them calling every day like this it works on my nerves and it up sets me really bad. I told XXXX people that call me that I would try to pay something next month and she screamed at me and said next month, why next month? I told her I had to see how my bills would run and I could not give her and amount so to how much I can pay. I know even if I could pay them it would not be more than {$4.00} or {$5.00} dollars if that much. They just keep calling and calling every day. They have been doing this for the pass 6 or 7 months and I ca n't take it any longer. My nerves are to bad and they runs my XXXX XXXX up by calling every day. If they were to slow down the calls except to may be once a month then that would be helpful a little but I still do n't know if I would have any money to pay them even then. I can try if I have any money left but I seriously doubt it not right now until my bills comes down. I am paying high bills right now and it is taking all of my money to just keep my house going so that I can have some where to live. It 's not that I do n't want to pay them but I do not have the money now. They ruined my Bank account and I had to close it because of all the over draft fees the Bank was charging me. Each day they sent the debit through for the {$300.00} and some dollars and every day the Bank charged me {$38.00} per transaction, I paid out a lot of money to the Bank for these transactions, money they could have had if they would not have kept trying to debit my account. I am so tired of this and I do n't know nothing else to do except not answer the phone but If I did that I could miss important phone calls from other people I need to talk to. I am just tired of the harassing phone calls. This is not good for my illness. Regardless of what I say to them they still call every day. I just want the calls to stop. I will pay something when ever I can.

03/24/2015,Bank account or service,Checking account,Using a debit or ATM card,,"I 'm no longer an account holder of SunTrust. I used to be until I realized how unethical of a company that is. Let me explain to you why I believe this : For years, SunTrust advertised and promoted in big letters their XXXX XXXX debit card. With that card, an account holder could earn XXXX mile for every {$1.00} spent ( for debit and credit card transactions ). SunTrust even advertised that they would not put a cap on a cardholder 's ability to earn miles. 

Over the past XXXX months, SunTrust must have reviewed their debit card portfolio and what they did as a result of their review is shocking : They closed all account holders who had earned above average number of miles regardless of the types of products they purchased, regardless of the length of their relationship with SunTrust, and regardless of the amount of money in their checking accounts. I know of at least XXXX cases where SunTrust contacted XXXX XXXX to have the miles in the cardholder 's account reversed!!! 

SunTrust is clearly engaging in what is commonly referred to as "" bait and switch '', a marketing strategy of getting customers to sign up for a product ( that, by the way, carries a yearly fee of {$75.00} ) and then, once a certain number of miles are earned, the account is closed. This is unacceptable and a regulatory violation. 

If SunTrust does not immediately stop closing accounts and reversing miles already earned, I 'll notify a well-known XXXX XXXX lawfirm to pursue a class action lawsuit against SunTrust and its XXXX and XXXX individually.
